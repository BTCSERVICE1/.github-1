GitHub takes the security of our software products and services seriously, including the open source code repositories managed through our GitHub organizations, such as [GitHub](https://github.com/GitHub).

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in this GitHub-owned open source repository, you can report it to us in one of two ways.

Dependabot is in scope for the [GitHub Bug Bounty Program](https://bounty.github.com/targets/dependabot.html). If you would like your finding to be considered for a bounty reward, please submit the vulnerability to us through [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/github) in order to be eligible to receive a bounty award.

If you do not wish to be considered for a bounty reward, please report the issue to us directly using [private vulnerability reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**

Thanks for helping make GitHub safe for everyone.
